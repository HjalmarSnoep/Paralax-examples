Parallax Animation simple Example

## It's hip!
These days everybody is doing animated parallax sites. Most people use jQuery just to get it working.
That's nonsense.

## differente techniques
There are a couple of different techniques used.
 - Shifting parallax layers giving a nice 3D effect. This can be found in the timeline example, all you need is to create a layer with class parallax and a scrollspeed. 
 - Complete timeline animations. Also in the timeline example, look at laag1.
 - Wait until an element is in view and then animate it via CSS. This example is the other html example is this repository.
 
 These techniques 1 & 2 are not mutually exclusivem but if you combine them you need to understand what happens in both..
 
 I assumed you wanted vertical, but the same technique can be used for horizontal. (Just switch width and height and X and  Y)
